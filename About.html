        <p> Hello! My name is Matthew Coppolo I am 26 years old and love everything about computers. I have been programming since 2015 and went to college at Florida
            International University. After graduation in 2020 I decided to explore other aspects of life but, I continued to code regardless. Currently I am looking to start
            a career as a software developer/engineer. I know many programming languages such C, C++, Java, and Python. I am also familiar with the work methodologies of SCRUM
            and other programming life cycles. I am expanding my understanding of Web Development hoping to become a full stack developer. Currently I am coding in HTTP, PHP,
            AJAX, JSON, JavaScript, C# and using mySQL in an effort to build a complete website. I am eager to start my career, if you are interested in my potential feel free to 
            explore this website or contact me at any time. You can get in touch with me with in the 'Contact' section above. Thank you for your time and consideration!
        </p>
